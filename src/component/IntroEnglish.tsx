                                I am looking for an original and different software development company. I also consider myself different.
                                I am a web developer with passion for turning coffe into code and solving problems with a keyboard and Google.
                                I have always been interested in web development and I have been continuosly learning and improving my skills in the past years. 
                                I am a family man with an unbelievable wife and two wonderful children too.
                                I have a proven career in the Procurement and Supply Chain sector, also in commercial banking in my earlies carreer but
                                What I really like is to get my creative side out as a Software Developer and that is why I am currently
                                rethinking my work objectives towards the Tech world in general and Software Development in particular.
                                The past year, I decided to return to web development and focus on learning several new technologies. 
                                I am not a Jr properly speaking, although I am looking to reach a team in which to learn, progress and consolidate as an important,
                                I really want to advance and progress and I can bring experience in many areas, as I said at the beginning, 
                                I am not the same as the others, I am different. Do you think It could fit with you? Let's talk.
